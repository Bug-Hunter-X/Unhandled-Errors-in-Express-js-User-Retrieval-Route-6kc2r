This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling during database interactions and user input validation.  The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, which doesn't handle potential errors from database queries or invalid user IDs.  The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling, ensuring the application behaves gracefully under various conditions.
